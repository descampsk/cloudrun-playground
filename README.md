# cloudrun-playground

## Description

This repository is used to demonstrate some features of Google Cloud Run. It contains examples and code snippets that illustrate how to use and interact with Google Cloud Run.

Google Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that enables you to run stateless containers that are invocable via web requests. It abstracts away all infrastructure management, so you can focus on what matters most â€” building great applications.

Stay tuned for more updates and feel free to contribute.
